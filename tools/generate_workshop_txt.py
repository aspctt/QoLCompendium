"""Rebuild QoLCompendium/workshop.txt from workshop-description.txt.

The Project Zomboid uploader reads the description out of workshop.txt, one
"description=" line per line of text. workshop-description.txt is where that text
is actually written and reviewed, so the two drift apart the moment one is edited
on its own. That drift is silent: the upload succeeds and ships the old text.

Steam rejects a description over 8000 characters with EResult 8, InvalidParam,
which reads as "Failed to update, result 8" in the uploader and says nothing about
length. So the limit is checked here, where the message can be useful.

    python tools/generate_workshop_txt.py [--check]

--check reports without writing, for a quick look before uploading.
