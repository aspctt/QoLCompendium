--// Hotbar Binding Sync
--// aspctt - 20.08.2026
--// Keeps the server's copy of every attached item's slot binding current, whoever wrote
--// it and by whatever route.
--//
--// Three fixes were made by finding a call site that changed an item's attached slot
--// without telling the server and adding the call there. Each was a real omission and
--// each was still incomplete, because the binding is written from more places than one
--// can enumerate by reading: our reorder, our attach override, vanilla's timed actions,
--// and the take off and put back at the tail of ISHotbar:refresh, at least. A player
--// kept losing a screwdriver through a path none of those covered.
--//
--// So this stops guessing at call sites. It watches the two fields the game actually
--// persists, remembers what was last sent for each item, and sends again when they
--// differ. It does not care who changed them.
--//
--// Cheap by construction. Nothing is sent while nothing changes, the comparison is two
--// values per attached item, and there are rarely more than a handful. syncItemFields is
--// a no-op outside a multiplayer client, so this idles completely in singleplayer.
--//
--// Client only. The client is the side that knows what it did.

--// Tuning
-- Often enough that a disconnect shortly after attaching still catches it, and idle
-- enough that it costs nothing: this is a table lookup per attached item.
